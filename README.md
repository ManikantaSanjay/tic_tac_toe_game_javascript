# Tic Tac Toe Game
## Description:
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game created as part of my course assignment on Udemy.
## Technologies Used:
HTML + CSS + JAVASCRIPT 
## Features:
* We play a game against a bot and there is a feature for reset and play again.
* To make a move, the player will use the mouse single click to mark a space. In this version, there is no provision to undo the move. As soon as the move is done, the game proceeds to the bot's move.
* When the game ends, it displays one of the following three outcomes:

I. You Win

II. You Lose

III. Tie Game

## Demo:
Watch the demo of the game played between human and the bot. 

Ps: I lost :pensive:
